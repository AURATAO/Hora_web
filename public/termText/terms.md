# Hora Global Terms of Service

_Last updated: July 13, 2025_

These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Hora platform (the “Platform”), which is owned and operated by Arcodiax LLC (“Arcodiax”, “we”, “our”, or “us”).
By accessing or using the Platform, you agree to be bound by these Terms and to enter into a legally binding agreement with Arcodiax LLC.

# Platform

## A. Online Marketplace

The Platform is a web- and app-based two-sided marketplace that facilitates connections between individuals and/or businesses seeking short-term services (“Supporter(s)”) and independent service providers (“Supporter(s)”), collectively referred to as "Users."
Supporters are independent business owners who perform Tasks under their own name or business entity, and not as employees or representatives of Hora. Supporters set their own rates for Tasks, subject to any pricing structures or minimums established by Hora. Hora does not deduct fees from these rates unless otherwise specified. Supporters utilize their own tools and operate independently, without control or direction from Hora. Supporters may:
**(a)** maintain their own Supporter base,
**(b)** offer services through other platforms, including competitors,
**(c)** accept or decline any Task or Supporter at their sole discretion.
Supporters engage Supporters directly, and any contractual relationship exists solely between the Supporter and the Supporter. Hora is not a party to any such agreement.
Any indication that a Supporter is “licensed,” “vetted,” “background checked,” “reliable,” “elite,” or similar designations only signifies that the Supporter has completed specific Platform registration steps or met certain criteria as defined by Hora. These terms:
**(i)** are provided solely for informational purposes to assist Supporters in evaluating Supporters,
**(ii)** do not constitute an endorsement, guarantee, or representation by Hora as to the Supporter's qualifications, licensure, insurance, trustworthiness, or suitability for any particular Task.
While the Platform may offer features to help streamline the selection of Supporters, Supporters are solely responsible for evaluating and selecting their Supporters and should conduct any due diligence they deem necessary prior to booking a Task.

## B. Hora’s Role

The Platform is not an employment agency or staffing business, and Hora is not the employer of any User. Users are not employees, partners, agents, joint venturers, independent contractors, or franchisees of Hora.
Users acknowledge and agree that:
**(a)** Hora does not:
**(i)** perform Tasks or employ individuals to perform Tasks;
**(ii)** supervise, direct, or control Supporters’ work, including work location, schedule, tools, or expenses;
**(iii)** guarantee the quality, timing, legality, or any aspect of Tasks or Users, including their conduct, qualifications, or communications.
**(b)** The formation of a Service Agreement between a Supporter and a Supporter does not create any employment, partnership, or agency relationship with Hora. Users do not have authority to act on behalf of Hora or modify any part of the Platform’s fee structure.
Hora is not responsible for and shall not be held liable for any employment-related obligations, including but not limited to workers’ compensation, payroll taxes, Social Security, Medicare, unemployment insurance, or any federal, state, or local tax obligations. Supporters are solely responsible for all income taxes and contributions applicable to themselves and any individuals they engage in connection with Tasks. Each User is solely responsible for correctly classifying any individuals they engage, in accordance with applicable law.

## C. License

Subject to your compliance with these Terms and the Hora Acceptable Use Policy, Hora grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to:
**(a)** access and use the Platform in the territories where it is available;
**(b)** download and use the Hora mobile application (“App”) on your personal device solely to access and use the Platform; and
**(c)** view any content, information, and materials made available through the Platform, solely for your personal and lawful use in accordance with the Platform’s intended purpose.
You agree to comply with the Hora Acceptable Use Policy at all times when using the Platform.
Users may not copy, reproduce, download, modify, reconfigure, reverse engineer, distribute, or retransmit any part of the Platform or its contents, in whole or in part, without prior written consent from Hora.

You authorize Hora and its third-party providers to collect, process, and retain your personal information for the purposes of verifying your identity and determining your eligibility to perform Tasks. Failure to complete or pass any required verification or background check may result in the suspension or termination of your access to the Platform.

# 2. Use of the Platform

### A. Account Registration and Identity Verification

_To access and use the Platform, all Users—whether acting as a Supporter or a Supporter—must register and create an account, providing complete, accurate, and up-to-date information, including but not limited to your full legal name, mailing address, email address, and telephone number. You agree to update this information promptly to ensure its continued accuracy. Failure to do so may result in suspension or termination of your access to the Platform._

_As a condition of registration and continued use of the Platform, all Users are required to complete identity verification through a third-party service provider, which may include, without limitation:_

- **(a)** Uploading a valid government-issued photo ID;
- **(b)** Completing a real-time facial recognition scan (selfie check);
- **(c)** Providing additional supporting documents, biometric data, or verification steps as required by our verification partner.

_By registering, you authorize Hora and its designated third-party providers (such as Stripe Identity and Checkr) to collect, process, and retain your personal information for the purposes of identity verification, fraud prevention, and determining your eligibility to use the Platform._

_Hora reserves the right to deny, suspend, or revoke access to any User who fails or refuses to complete the required verification process, or where verification results raise reasonable safety, integrity, or legal concerns._

### B. Account Security

_You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your Platform account, including your login credentials (such as username, password, and any authentication information) and any associated account numbers. You accept full responsibility for all activities that occur under your account, whether or not authorized by you._

_Hora has no obligation to monitor or control any User’s account activity and disclaims any liability arising from unauthorized use of your account. If you believe or suspect that your account or password has been accessed or used without your authorization, or if you become aware of any other actual or suspected breach of security, you agree to notify Hora immediately at info@my-hora.com._

_Hora reserves the right to take any action it deems necessary, including but not limited to suspending or terminating your account, in order to protect the integrity and security of the Platform and its Users._

### C. Supporter Onboarding

**(i) Background Checks.**  
_To the extent permitted by applicable law, all Users (including both Supporters and Supporters) may be subject to a review process before gaining access to, or while continuing to use, the Platform. This process may include, but is not limited to, identity verification and criminal background checks, conducted through trusted third-party service providers (“Background Checks”)._

_By using the Platform, you acknowledge and agree that you may be required to undergo such Background Checks as a condition of access or continued participation, and you authorize Hora and its third-party providers to collect, process, and use your personal information for these purposes._

_Given the interactive and trust-based nature of the services offered on the Platform, Hora reserves the right to deny, suspend, or terminate access to the Platform at any time based on the results of Background Checks, concerns regarding user behavior, or failure or refusal to complete any required verification._

_Hora does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of any Background Check information provided by third-party services, nor does it assume any responsibility for false or misleading statements made by Users, regardless of whether a Background Check was performed._

**(ii) Professional Licensing.**  
_Hora does not independently verify whether Supporters possess the licenses, permits, or registrations required to perform specific Tasks. It may be unlawful to perform certain types of Tasks without such credentials, and doing so may result in legal consequences including fines or enforcement action._

_Tasks that may be subject to professional licensing, certification, or regulatory requirements include, without limitation, medical or psychological services, beauty or aesthetic treatments, legal, accounting, tax preparation, or other financial advisory services, and intimate or adult-related services. Such Tasks are strictly prohibited on the Platform unless expressly authorized by Hora and permitted by applicable law._

_Users are solely responsible for ensuring that they do not post or perform Tasks in any category that is legally restricted or requires a professional credential. Hora may remove or reject any Task that appears to violate these rules, and may suspend or terminate the associated account._

_Supporters are solely responsible for ensuring that they comply with all applicable licensing and regulatory requirements. While Hora may, at its discretion, establish guidelines or filters to help prevent the posting or performance of certain prohibited or regulated Tasks, Hora does not guarantee the legality or appropriateness of any Task posted or accepted on the Platform. All Users remain fully responsible for ensuring compliance with applicable laws._

_If you have questions about how national, state, or local laws apply to a specific Task, you are encouraged to seek independent legal advice before posting or performing such Task._

_Supporters are solely responsible for determining whether a Supporter is appropriately qualified to perform the Task, and for confirming that all required licenses, permits, or registrations have been obtained._

### D. Service Agreement

_The Platform enables Users to post, discover, and accept Tasks. Once a Supporter accepts a Task invitation via the Platform interface, the Supporter and the Supporter may communicate further through the in-app messaging feature (the “Chat Thread”) to confirm the scope, timing, location, and any relevant considerations (e.g., potential hazards or access instructions)._

_Upon confirmation by the Supporter, a legally binding agreement (“Service Agreement”) is formed between the Supporter and the Supporter. This includes the Task details, pricing, and any additional terms mutually agreed upon within the Chat Thread. The Service Agreement is solely between the two Users. Hora is not a party to any Service Agreement and assumes no liability arising from such contracts._

_Supporters acknowledge and agree that they act as independent service providers exercising their own business judgment. They assume the risk of profit or loss and are solely responsible for fulfilling their contractual obligations._

_To protect user privacy and safety, specific Task location details (e.g., exact addresses) may only be disclosed after a Task is accepted and a Service Agreement is formed._

### E. Other Parties

**(i) Supporter Assistants.**  
_Where approved in advance by the Requester through the Chat Thread, Supporters may engage assistants, helpers, subcontractors, or other personnel (“Supporter Assistant(s)”) to perform all or part of a Task. All Supporter Assistants must be registered Users of the Platform and must meet the same requirements applicable to Supporters under this Agreement._

_Supporters are solely responsible for the conduct and performance of their Supporter Assistants. This includes, without limitation:_

- **(a)** the lawful payment of compensation, benefits, and expenses;
- **(b)** any applicable tax withholdings or reporting obligations; and
- **(c)** ensuring that all Supporter Assistants comply with Platform policies and are registered as Supporters.

_Hora is not responsible for any acts or omissions of Supporter Assistants._

**(ii) Requester Agents.**  
_The Platform is designed for use by registered Users only. Each Task must be booked for the benefit of the registered Requester themselves, who must be present and directly involved in the interaction with the Supporter, unless expressly authorized by Hora in writing._

_At this time, Requesters may not schedule Tasks on behalf of third parties, including but not limited to family members, friends, or individuals receiving services as a gift, unless such individuals are also registered Users who have completed all required identity verification._

_If Hora later permits Task delegation, the following shall apply:_

- _If a Requester is expressly authorized by Hora to allow another individual (“Requester Agent”) to either book or receive a Task on their behalf, the Requester is deemed to have appointed that individual as their agent for the purposes of that Task. The Requester assumes full responsibility for the acts and omissions of the Requester Agent, and the Supporter may treat any instructions given by the Requester Agent as if given directly by the Requester._

_Hora reserves the right to suspend or terminate any account found to be arranging services for unregistered or unverified third parties without express authorization._

# 3. Fees, Billing, Invoicing, and Payment; Cancellation

_The terms governing Task payments (including Supporter compensation and Hora’s service fees), invoicing, billing procedures, and cancellation policies are set forth in the Fees, Payments, and Cancellation Supplemental Terms, which form an integral part of this Agreement._

_Unless expressly stated otherwise, all fees paid on the Platform — including, without limitation, booking fees, Supporter compensation, and Hora commissions — are non-refundable._

_By using the Platform, Users agree to the following general principles, subject to more detailed terms in the Supplemental Terms:_

- **(a)** Minimum Booking Requirement: _All Tasks must meet the Platform’s minimum billing threshold, which is currently one hour. Rates begin at €12/hour unless otherwise specified._
- **(b)** Prepayment: _Once a Task is matched and confirmed by a Supporter, the Requester is required to prepay for the initial agreed duration._
- **(c)** Time Adjustments: _If the Task is completed early, remaining time is credited to the Requester's account in the form of time credits (based on minutes), which may be applied to future bookings. If the Task exceeds the original booking time, additional charges will apply and a supplemental invoice will be issued._
- **(d)** Disbursement Timing: _Supporters are paid 24 hours after the Task is completed, provided that no disputes have been filed._
- **(e)** Optional Add-Ons: _Requesters may purchase enhanced support features (such as insurance coverage, priority dispute handling, or refund eligibility) during checkout for an additional fee._
- **(f)** Subscription Services: _Users may choose to enroll in a subscription plan offering premium features; such fees are billed separately._
- **(g)** Cancellations and No-Shows: _Requesters and Supporters are subject to specific cancellation and no-show penalties, which may include flat-rate fees, partial refunds in platform credit, or forfeiture of time credits. Exceptions (e.g., first-time forgiveness) may apply._

_Hora reserves the right to determine the form of any refund — whether to the original payment method or as platform credit — unless otherwise required by law._

_All Users acknowledge and accept that additional details, rates, and exceptions are outlined in the Fees, Payments, and Cancellation Supplemental Terms, which may be updated periodically._

# 4. Contests and Promotional Codes

_Hora may, from time to time, offer promotional codes, discounts, referral bonuses, contests, or loyalty campaigns. All such offers are discretionary, non-transferable, and subject to separate terms and conditions, which may be modified or withdrawn at any time without notice._

_Hora does not guarantee the availability, accuracy, or effectiveness of any promotional offer, and is not liable for any failure, misuse, or loss associated with these offers. By participating, you acknowledge that all promotions are governed by the limitations of liability described in Section 13 of these Terms._

# 5. Public Areas

_The Platform may include community features such as forums, chat threads, public profiles, ratings, reviews, or other communication tools (“Public Areas”) where Users can share messages, feedback, or other content._

_While the Platform does not currently provide features such as content flagging, reporting, or blocking, Hora may introduce such tools in the future without prior notice. Users are encouraged to communicate respectfully and use the Platform in good faith._

_Hora disclaims any responsibility for user-generated content and is not liable for any actions or communications between Users in Public Areas. However, Hora may take appropriate action, including content removal or account restrictions, if any misuse or suspected violations occur._

# 6. Deactivation and Suspension

_To help ensure the safety, trust, and proper functioning of the Platform, Hora reserves the right to take appropriate action if we believe a User has violated any part of this Agreement, including but not limited to misuse, fraud, abusive behavior, or interference with Platform operations._

_In such cases, Hora may, at its sole discretion:_

- **(a)** _Temporarily suspend your access to the Platform while investigating the issue; and/or_
- **(b)** _Permanently deactivate your account or restrict your use of certain Platform features if a breach is confirmed._

_Where required by applicable law, Hora will provide you with written notice of its determination, and you may submit an appeal within 14 days of receiving such notice by contacting us at the address provided in Section 17 (Contact Information), including your reasons and any supporting information._

_If your account is suspended or deactivated, you agree that you may not create a new account under your own or any other identity, name, or business, nor may you access the Platform through another User’s account._

**Platform Integrity Note:**  
_Hora may also take proactive action to suspend or restrict access to accounts that raise reasonable safety, trust, or policy concerns, including—but not limited to—situations involving false identity information, repeated cancellations, harmful behavior, or attempts to circumvent Platform safeguards. While not all of these features are in place in our MVP, Hora reserves the right to expand its trust & safety tools over time._

# 7. Termination

**By You:**  
_You may terminate this Agreement at any time by ceasing all use of the Platform and requesting deactivation of your account via the account settings or by contacting Hora’s support team._

**By Hora:**  
_Hora may terminate this Agreement and your access to the Platform at any time, with or without notice, if you breach any provision of the Agreement, violate applicable laws, or if your use of the Platform creates risk or potential legal exposure for Hora or other Users (including as described in Section 6 above)._
